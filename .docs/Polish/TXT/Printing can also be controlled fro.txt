Printing can also be controlled from within Batch Script via the NET PRINT command.

Syntax
PRINT [/D:device] [[drive:][path]filename[...]]
Where /D:device - Specifies a print device.

Example
print c:\example.txt /c /d:lpt1
The above command will print the example.txt file to the parallel port lpt1.

Command Line Printer Control
As of Windows 2000, many, but not all, printer settings can be configured from Windows's command line using PRINTUI.DLL and RUNDLL32.EXE

Where some of the options available are the following −

/dl − Delete local printer.

/dn − Delete network printer connection.

/dd − Delete printer driver.

Testing if a Printer Exists
There can be cases wherein you might be connected to a network printer instead of a local printer. In such cases, it is always beneficial to check if a printer exists in the first place before printing.

The existence of a printer can be evaluated with the help of the RUNDLL32.EXE PRINTUI.DLL which is used to control most of the printer settings.

Example
SET PrinterName = Test Printer
SET file=%TEMP%\Prt.txt
RUNDLL32.EXE PRINTUI.DLL,PrintUIEntry /Xg /n "%PrinterName%" /f "%file%" /q

IF EXIST "%file%" (
   ECHO %PrinterName% printer exists
) ELSE (
   ECHO %PrinterName% printer does NOT exists
)
The above command will do the following −

It will first set the printer name and set a file name which will hold the settings of the printer.

The RUNDLL32.EXE PRINTUI.DLL commands will be used to check if the printer actually exists by sending the configuration settings of the file to the file Prt.txt
