🎯 Purpose of the Script
This script removes Temporary Internet Files stored in the user profile.
These files are created by Windows components and older browsers, 
and over time they may:
- slow down the system
- cause display or caching issues
- take up unnecessary disk space
The script automates the cleanup process safely and quickly.

---

🔐 Requirements
- Windows operating system
- Administrator privileges (the script automatically elevates itself)

---

🧩 How the Script Works
1. Administrator Rights Check

net session >nul 2>&1
if %errorlevel% neq 0 (
    powershell -Command "Start-Process '%~f0' -Verb RunAs"
    exit /b
)

If the script is not running with admin rights, it restarts itself 
with elevated permissions.

2. Display Header
The script prints author information and sets the console title.

3. Notify User About the Cleanup
echo Deleting temporary internet files...
ping localhost -n 3 >nul


A short pause is added for clarity.

4. Delete Temporary Internet Files

del /f /q "%userprofile%\AppData\Local\Microsoft\Windows\Temporary Internet Files\*.*"

This command:
- /f forces deletion
- /q suppresses confirmation prompts
- deletes all files inside the Temporary Internet Files folder for the current user

5. Clear Screen and Display Completion Message
cls
echo Temporary Internet files were successfully deleted...

ping localhost -n 3 >nul

The script confirms that the cleanup is complete and pauses briefly before closing.

📝 Notes
- Only files are deleted — folders remain intact.
- The script affects only the current user’s cache directory.
- It is safe to run regularly to keep the system clean.
- Modern browsers may not use this folder, but Windows components still can.
